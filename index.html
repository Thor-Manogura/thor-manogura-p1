    <h3> Hi, My name is Thor Manogura</h3>

    <p>I developed this Website for my creativity to showcase in photography and Web development utilizing HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, etc.</p>
    <h4> Why Photography?</h4>
    <p>Photography play an important role in everyone’s life – they connect us to our past, they remind us of people, places,
    feelings, and stories. They can help us to know who we are. <b> Photography has the power to move us</b>, photos can grab our attention and speak directly to our emotion. Our images can express joy and sorrow, wonder and sympathy. Every human emotion can find a place in photography. For
    many years I never valued my photographs of overcast landscape because I believed that there was no beauty in a land
    with muted colours and a leaden sky. I wanted the land to be alive with colour and vibrancy.</p>
    <p><b>Photography make us artist</b>. Photography allows us to express ourselves through an art form. We notice a beautiful landscape or an old man’s lined
    face and we want to capture it. Each of us will have a different reason to do so but, essentially, we want to create
    something. However humdrum our nine-to-five lives may be, the creation of an image makes us an artist. It feels good.</p>
    <p>Images are much more than a simple record. Photography speaks to the best and most generous part of our human nature –
    the desire to share what we find beautiful and interesting with others. You only have to look at Flickr and a multitude
    of photo sharing sites to see this impulse at work. Millions of people sharing their personal, passionate and sometimes
    quirky take on the world around them. Our images can involve a world of strangers in our life. How powerful is that?</p>
    <p>When you ask people what possessions they would rescue from their burning house, one of the most frequent answers is the
    photograph album or a computer with their digital images. When in panic mode it’s interesting that we would probably
    grab photos rather than valuable jewelry. This impulse to save our recorded memories is a powerful force which tells us
    much about the role of photography in our lives and our constant desire to distil our most precious moments into images. We preserve the important events and people in our lives. The ceremonies of birth and birthdays, marriages and
    anniversaries, holidays and new houses are all recorded because they matter. Photographs are our personal story, a
    timeline of our lives filled with faces and places that we love. They are our story, which we can share with others. The
    hundreds of images come together to form a narrative of our lives.</p>
