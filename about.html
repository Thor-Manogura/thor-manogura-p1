           <p> When I emigrated to the United States with my older siblings from the Philippines, my life changed forever. While my
            mother worked in Hong Kong, she met a man online. Later, he helped her relocate to Toronto, Canada, so she could earn
            money for our family and meet her in person. The man who would later become my stepfather asked my mom to marry him.
            Their marriage in 2008 would dramatically change my life. In the Philippines, I did not even have a career goal. I
            probably did not realize it in 2012, but my arrival in the U.S. truly opened up an entirely new world for me.</p>
            
            <p>When I arrived in the United States, I had to adapt to a different environment, culture, language and educational
            system. I felt as though I had stepped onto a different planet. I could not start school until January. School
            administrators started me in 6th grade, even though my age might have placed me in 7th. They made an excellent decision
            for me because I needed to basically learn English, so I could truly understand the work in all of my subjects. Learning
            the English language was certainly the greatest challenge in the early years of my life. When I look back upon that
            first semester in an MPS school, I can hardly believe that I kept pace with other students and ultimately passed the
            grade.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, I needed to adapt to a completely different diet. In the Philippines, we frequently ate fish. In the United
            States, I discovered pizza! Over time, I also learned that I could not eat ice cream for breakfast, even though my mom
            wanted to spoil me because we spent six years apart from each other. I also needed to adapt to an entirely different
            climate. Snow? I had never felt the cold and wetness of these frozen flakes. In the Philippines, we did not experience
            “seasons.” It’s hot throughout the year. Therefore, I needed to adapt to sub-freezing temperatures and harsh
            wind-chills. Gloves, knit winter caps, and insulated coats were completely new experiences for me.</p>
            
            <p>When I started 6th grade, I felt very shy. Due to the fact that I spoke very little English, I found it very difficult
            to communicate with teachers and fellow students. I felt certain anxiety because I could not easily talk with people who
            seemed to want to get to know me. I never missed a day of school,l because I especially wanted to develop friendships
            with people my own age. Within a few weeks, I felt accepted by my peers. I started to form special friendships. However,
            the majority of my teachers treated me the same as any other students who were fluent in English.
            </p>
           <p> I needed to study twice as hard as the average student in my middle school. In addition to putting forth extra effort,
            an ESL class (English as a Second Language), was invaluable to me. This class was so important because I realized that I
            was not the only student struggling with English and classes. I met six other students who were faced with a challenge.
            I was not alone. This program supported me in adjusting to a new language all the way through 8th grade. My
            understanding of subjects and participation in class steadily increased. Improvement in my grades followed. As my
            confidence soared. My interactions with other students increased, too. I truly felt successful as an American student. I
            was awarded an IB Learner Profile Award, the "Most Improved" student in 2013-2014. I also received the award for
            "Risk-Taker" in recognition of my willingness to embrace the attributes of taking prudent risks.
           </p> 
            When I arrived in the United States in 2012, I recall that my dad asked me, “What do you want to be when you grow up?”
            As a 12-year-old, I replied, “A pilot.” As I progressed through my freshman and sophomore years, I recognized my
            interest in graphic design that soon evolved into a greater interest in web design. Once again, as a child in the
            Philippines, I could never have imagined working in the field of web design. I had limited access to my brother’s
            computer in the Philippines. I mostly played video games. However, with a cell phone, my own laptop and access to my
            brother’s powerful computer here, I began developing my computer skills with an eye on the future - a career in the
            computer field.
           <p> 
            I started my high school career full of ambition to expand my experiences in the United States, and I discovered the
            value of extracurricular activities. I enjoyed working as part of the stage crew. I played tennis for two seasons.
            However, I found my greatest challenge and joy in serving on the chess team. Our team experienced success in three State
            tournaments. In view of my leadership skills, my chess team coach asked me to serve as captain and I accepted this
            challenging role for my senior year. Yet, my work to lead the team has already started. As the season progress in Chess,
            my coach sees my high motivation toward chess, organizing practice and leader skills, thus he promoted me as an
            Assistant Coach. This achievement will allow me to pursue my career in College with confidence and leadership.</p>
